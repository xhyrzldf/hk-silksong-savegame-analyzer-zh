# Hollow Knight Silksong Savegame Analyzer
  
For all the completionists out there: I created a tool to check the progress on you savefile:  
  
http://silksong-completionist.com/  
  
Currently everything needed for 100% completion is taken into account.  
In the future I also want to add all bosses and hunters journal entries + other stuff you might miss to the tool. And who knows, maybe even 112% when DLCs drop ;)

Big thank you to:
